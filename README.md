## gruber darker

this port is terrible  
  
included some of my personal preferences like marking specialchars with a different color  

[source emacs theme](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme)
  
# todo  
 - [ ] make it work in gui
 - [ ] change color of sidebar when error detected
 - [ ] change linenr color when on line
